# StoreSalesPrediction

Store Sales Prediction is a machine learning-based project that utilizes advanced algorithms to forecast the sales of items from a particular outlet based on input data. This project aims to provide valuable insights to businesses, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, sales strategies, and resource allocation.

### AIM : 
To make a solution which is able to predit the Sales of Item from particular outlet.

### Goal :

Use Machine Learning to make this solution as well with the help of Data Analysis (EDA) understand the data, and once when we found solution then deploy that solution as Web-App.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**  - as a technology, which is back support of all things like Python gives the support to all the operations.
- **EDA**     - for Data Analysis, so that we can understand the data in better way.
- **Machine Learning** -  to make a different-different models on the data.
- **Flask** - for making an API.
- **HTML & CSS** - for making the frotend of the application.



## Future Scope

- Use multiple Algorithms.
- Do more data crunching
- Optimize app.py
- Work on Front-End
